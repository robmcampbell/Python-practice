# Python-practice üêç
After spending a month or so learning key Python skills and syntax, I wanted to put my work together in a portfolio so I can keep my projects organized and demonstrate my progress. In this folder, you will find a selection of shorter projects I have been working on to practice my coding. These projects are intended to be quite "rough and ready" but serve to track my development. Over time, I hope to move on to more challenging, larger coding projects and place those in a different repository. Enjoy!
